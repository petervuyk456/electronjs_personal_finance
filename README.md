Nope... just a guy who codes and is interested in a strong financial future.

Hello! Welcome to the end of your financial visibility and planning woes. I can't ensure you'll get there without your own commitment and effort, but I can show you how to apply that commitment and effort in a way that has served me well.

   - Insurance, debt, and credit management

# Why

I am a firm believer in effective productivity and a firmer believer in the idea that information gives us power - at minimum, power over our decisions and why we make them. That being said, the information we need from our finances is so personalized in terms of goals, risk aversion, lifestyle, financial starting points, etc., that it is difficult to imagine a 3rd-party doing it for us... at least it sure is for me. In many cases, people pay these 3rd-parties money (not to mention the value of their data and personal information), for great resources that are generally free in other places, albeit at sometimes lower quality.

So I asked - why not have it be awesome and free and customizable/open-source AND educational overall?

Whew... sure seems like a lot to ask for these days. Except, not really. The technology is out there, we just all have to agree that financial literacy should be a right not a privilege. Without it, we rely on more luck than anything to get out from under it all. In a world where "help yourself" is practiced a lot more than "love thy neighbor", the least we can do is arm the masses with the KNOWLEDGE and TOOLS to do money the right way and have a chance/choice to earn a life of improved and improving finanical circumstance. There is no substitute for financial assistance to those in the greatest need... however, society's greatest long-term investment for fighting poverty and crime will always - and should always - be education. With that, and regardless of this repo, I challenge you to be the captain of your own finanical boat - no excuses, just live it and learn it.
